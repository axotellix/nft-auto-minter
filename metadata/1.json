    "description": "WAR IS BUSINESS\r\n\rWe spend an unimaginable amount of money on weapon. It's hard to believe that in 21st century we still haven't managed to reach that level of development when all these guns, rockets and bombs are not needed for solving our problems. Mainly it's because of politicians & businessmen who need weapon to be produced in order to earn money. Just imagine what a wonderful place our world would be if we didn't waste that incredible amount of money and allocated them for science, education, improving living conditions and for charity especially.",

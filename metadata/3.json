    "description": "WAR IS POLITICS\r\n\rThe best way to stop wars - forget about nationalities. Of course, it doesn't mean we should leave behind our traditions, our history. We only have to learn to be more tolerant to each other. One have to realise that bad deeds mustn't be associated with nationality. We cannot blame the entire nation for the actions of one. Everything that is happening now - is all about politics. And we mustn't let it cause conflicts on the national ground. We're all one nation - Earthlings. And instead of maintaining conflicts and helping politicians profit, we should unite and support each other. Staying united is the only way to stop wars.",
